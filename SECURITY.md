## Afterwards
Expect to recieve an email either accepting or declining the vulneraility, if declined this is NOT considered an issue and you may fully disclose it to the general public
If accepted DO NOT disclose the issue and we will work on resolving it promptly. The software will be rolled back to the last "stable" version and a new patch will be released in the form of an update.
Advisories will be published if the issue is of major concern and will be decided case-by-case
